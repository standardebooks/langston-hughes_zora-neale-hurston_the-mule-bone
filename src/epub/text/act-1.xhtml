			</h2>
			<p>SETTING: The raised porch of JOE CLARK’S Store and the street in front. Porch stretches almost completely across the stage, with a plank bench at either end. At the center of the porch three steps leading from street. Rear of porch, center, door to the store. On either side are single windows on which signs, at left, “POST OFFICE”, and at right, “GENERAL STORE” are painted. Soap boxes, axe handles, small kegs, etc., on porch on which townspeople sit and lounge during action. Above the roof of the porch the “false front”, or imitation second story of the shop is seen with large sign painted across it “JOE CLARK’S GENERAL STORE”. Large kerosine street lamp on post at right in front of porch.</p>
			<p>Saturday afternoon and the villagers are gathered around the store. Several men sitting on boxes at edge of porch chewing sugar cane, spitting tobacco juice, arguing, some whittling, others eating peanuts. During the act the women all dressed up in starched dresses parade in and out of store. People buying groceries, kids playing in the street, etc. General noise of conversation, laughter and children shouting. But when the curtain rises there is momentary lull for cane-chewing. At left of porch four men are playing cards on a soap box, and seated on the edge of the porch at extreme right two children are engaged in a checker game, with the board on the floor between them.</p>
			<p>When the curtain goes up the following characters are discovered on the porch: MAYOR JOE CLARK, the storekeeper; DEACON HAMBO; DEACON GOODWIN; Old Man MATT BRAZZLE; WILL CODY; SYKES JONES; LUM BOGER, the young town marshall; LIGE MOSELY and WALTER THOMAS, two village wags; TOM NIXON and SAM MOSELY, and several others, seated on boxes, kegs, benches and floor of the porch. TONY TAYLOR is sitting on steps of porch with empty basket. MRS. TAYLOR comes out with her arms full of groceries, empties them into basket and goes back in store. All the men are chewing sugar cane earnestly with varying facial expressions. The noise of the breaking and sucking of cane can be clearly heard in the silence. Occasionally the laughter and shouting of children is heard nearby off stage.</p>

				Don’t keer if it tis—I don’t want nothin’—not even hair—between me and God. (General laughter—LIGE joins in as well. Cane chewing keeps up. Silence for a moment.)</p>

				(Coming forward) Well, sir! (Takes bone in both hands and looks up and down the length of it) If ’tain’t my ole mule! This sho was one hell of a mule, too.

				<p class="drama">LINDSAY.<br/>
				(Laughing) Yeah, I ’member seein’ you comin’ down de road just so … (He limps wid one hand on his buttocks) one day.</p>
				<p class="drama">BRAZZLE.<br/>
				Dis mule was so evil he used to try to bite and kick when I’d go in de stable to feed ’im.</p>
				<p class="drama">WALTER.<br/>
				He was too mean to git fat. He was so skinny you could do a week’s washing on his ribs for a washboard and hang ’em up on his hip-bones to dry.</p>
				<p class="drama">LIGE.<br/>
				I ’member one day, Brazzle, you sent yo’ boy to Winter Park after some groceries wid a basket. So here he went down de road ridin’ dis mule wid dis basket on his arm…. Whut you reckon dat ole contrary mule done when he got to dat crooked place in de road going round Park Lake? He turnt right round and went through de handle of dat basket … wid de boy still up on his back. (General laughter)</p>
				<p class="drama">BRAZZLE.<br/>
				Yeah, he up and died one Sat’day just for spite … but he was too contrary to lay down on his side like a mule orter and die decent. Naw, he made out to lay down on his narrer contracted back and die wid his feets sticking straight up in de air just so. (He gets down on his back and illustrates.) We drug him out to de swamp wid ’im dat way, didn’t we, Hambo?</p>
				<p class="drama">JOE CLARK.<br/>
				I God, Brazzle, we all seen it. Didn’t we all go to de draggin’ out? More folks went to yo’ mule’s draggin’ out than went to last school closing…. Bet there ain’t been a thing right in mule-hell for four years.</p>

				<p class="drama">HAMBO.<br/>
				(Slicing some plug-cut tobacco) Nope, wan’t there dis time.</p>
				<p class="drama">WALTER.<br/>
				Looka here, Hambo. Y’all Baptist carry dis close-communion business too far. If a person ain’t half drownded in de lake and half et up by alligators, y’all think he ain’t baptized, so you can’t take communion wid him. Now I reckon you can’t even drink lemonade and eat chicken perlow wid us.</p>
				<p class="drama">HAMBO.<br/>
				My Lord, boy, youse just <i>full</i> of words. Now, in de first place, if this year’s picnic was lak de one y’all had last year … you ain’t had no lemonade for us Baptists to turn down. You had a big ole barrel of rain water wid about a pound of sugar in it and one lemon cut up over de top of it.</p>
				<p class="drama">LIGE.<br/>
				Man, you sho kin mold ’em!</p>
				<p class="drama">WALTER.<br/>
				Well, I went to de Baptist picnic wid my mouf all set to eat chicken, when lo and behold y’all had chitlings! Do Jesus!</p>
				<p class="drama">LINDSAY.<br/>
				Hold on there a minute. There was plenty chicken at dat picnic, which I do know is right.</p>
				<p class="drama">WALTER.<br/>
				Only chicken I seen was half a chicken yo’ pastor musta tried to swaller whole cause he was choked stiff as a board when I come long … wid de whole deacon’s board beating him in de back, trying to knock it out his throat.</p>
				<p class="drama">LIGE.<br/>
				Say, dat puts me in de mind of a Baptist brother that was crazy ’bout de preachers and de preacher was crazy ’bout feeding his face. So his son got tired of trying to beat dese stump-knockers to de grub on the table, so one day he throwed out some slams ’bout dese preachers. Dat made his old man mad, so he tole his son to git out. He boy ast him “Where must I go, papa?” He says, “Go on to hell I reckon … I don’t keer where you go.”</p>
				<p class="drama">So de boy left and was gone seven years. He come back one cold, windy night and rapped on de door. “Who dat?” de old man ast him “It’s me, Jack.” De old man opened de door, so glad to see his son agin, and tole Jack to come in. He did and looked all round de place. Seven or eight preachers was sitting round de fire eatin’ and drinkin’.</p>
				<p class="drama">“Where you been all dis time, Jack?” de old man ast him.</p>
				<p class="drama">“I been to hell,” Jack tole him.</p>
				<p class="drama">“Tell us how it is down there, Jack.”</p>
				<p class="drama">“Well,” he says, “It’s just like it is here … you cain’t git to de fire for de preachers.”</p>
				<p class="drama">HAMBO.<br/>
				Boy, you kin lie just like de cross-ties from Jacksonville to Key West. De presidin’ elder must come round on his circuit teaching y’all how to tell ’em, cause you couldn’t lie dat good just natural.</p>
				<p class="drama">WALTER.<br/>
				Can’t nobody beat Baptist folks lying … and I ain’t never found out how come you think youse so important.</p>
				<p class="drama">LINDSAY.<br/>
				Ain’t we got de finest and de biggest church? Macedonia Baptist will hold more folks than any two buildings in town.</p>
				<p class="drama">LIGE.<br/>
				Thass right, y’all got a heap more church than you got members to go in it.</p>
				<p class="drama">HAMBO.<br/>
				Thass all right … y’all ain’t got neither de church nor de members. Everything that’s had in this town got to be held in our church.</p>

				You try to take any shoes offa me!</p>
				<p class="drama">LIGE.<br/>
				(Pacifying them) Aw, there ain’t no use of all that. What you all want to start this quarreling for over a little jokin’.</p>
				<p class="drama">JIM.<br/>
				Nobody’s quarreling…. I’m just playin’a little for Daisy and Dave’s out there clownin’with her.</p>
				<p class="drama">CLARK.<br/>
				(In doorway) I ain’t gonna have no fussin’round my store, no way. Shut up, you all.</p>
				<p class="drama">JIM.<br/>
				Well, Mayor Clark, I ain’t mad with him. We’se been friends all our lives. He’s slept in my bed and wore my clothes and et my grub….</p>
				<p class="drama">DAVE.<br/>
				I et your grub? And many time as you done laid down with your belly full of my grandma’s collard greens. You done et my meat and bread a whole lot more times than I et your stewed fish-heads.</p>
				<p class="drama">JIM.<br/>
				I’d rather eat stewed fish-heads than steal out of other folkses houses so much till you went to sleep on the roost and fell down one night and broke up the settin’hen. (Loud laughter from the crowd)</p>
				<p class="drama">DAVE.<br/>
				Youse a liar if you say I stole anybody’s chickens. I didn’t have to. But you … ’fore you started goin’around with me, playin’ that little box of yours, you was so hungry you had the white mouth. If it wasn’t for these white folks throwin’<i>me</i> money for <i>my</i> dancin’, you would be thin as a whisper right now.</p>
				<p class="drama">JIM.<br/>
				(Laughing sarcastically) Your dancin’! You been leapin’around here like a tailless monkey in a wash pot for a long time and nobody was payin’no ’tention to you, till I come along playing.</p>
				<p class="drama">LINDSAY.<br/>
				Boys, boys, that ain’t no way for friends to carry on.</p>
				<p class="drama">DAISY.<br/>
				Well, if you all gonna keep up this quarrelin’and carryin’on I’m goin’home. ’Bout time for me to be gittin’back to my white folks anyhow. It’s dark now. I’m goin’, even if I have to go by myself. I shouldn’t a stopped by here nohow.</p>
				<p class="drama">JIM.<br/>
				(Stopping his quarrel) You ain’t gonna go home by yourself. I’m goin’with you.</p>
				<p class="drama">DAVE.<br/>
				(Singing softly)<br/>
				  It may be so,<br/>
				  I don’t know.<br/>
				  But it sounds to me<br/>
				  Like a lie.</p>
				<p class="drama">WALTER.<br/>
				Dave ain’t’ got as much rabbit blood as folks thought.</p>
				<p class="drama">DAVE.<br/>
				Tell ’em ’bout me. (Turns to DAISY) Won’t you choose a treat on me, Miss Daisy, ’fore we go?</p>
				<p class="drama">DAISY.<br/>
				(Coyly) Yessir, thank you. I wants a drink of soda water.</p>

				(Sitting down on the edge of porch with one foot on the step and lights a cigarette pretending not to be bothered.) Aw, I’ll get her when I want her. Let him treat her, but see who struts around that lake and down the railroad with her by and by.</p>
