			<p>SETTING: <i>A high stretch of railroad track thru a luxurious Florida forest. It is near sundown.</i></p>
			<p>ACTION: <i>When the curtain rises there is no one on the stage, but there is a tremendous noise and hubbub off-stage right. There are yells of derision and shouts of anger. Part of the mob is trying to keep JIM in town, and part is driving him off. After a full minute of this, JIM enters with his guitar hanging around his neck and his coat over his shoulder. The sun is dropping low and red thru the forest. He is looking back angrily and shouting at the mob. A missile is thrown after him. JIM drops his coat and guitar and grabs up a piece of brick, and makes threatening gestures of throwing it.</i></p>
			<div class="chapter">
				<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">JIM</td>
				(Running back the way he came and hurling the brick with all his might) I’ll kill some o’ you old box-ankled niggers. (Grabs up another piece of brick.) I’m out o’ your old town. Now just let some of you old half-pint Baptists let yo’ wooden God and Cornstalk Jesus fool you into hittin’ me. (Threatens to throw again. There are some frightened screams and the mob is heard running back.) I’m glad I’m out o’ yo’ ole town anyhow. I ain’t never comin’ back no mo’, neither. You ole ugly-rump niggers done ruint de town anyhow.</p>
				<tr><td/><td><i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">There is complete silence off stage. JIM walks a few steps with his coat and guitar, then sits down on the railroad embankment facing the audience. He pulls off one shoe and pours the sand out. He holds the shoe in his hand a moment and looks wistfully back down the railroad track.</i></td></tr>
				<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">JIM</td>
				Lawd, folks sho is deceitful. (He puts on the shoe and looks back down the track again.) I never woulda thought people woulda acted like that. (Laces up the shoe) Specially Dave Carter, much as me and him done progue’d ’round together goin’ in swimmin’ an’ playin’ ball an’ serenadin’ de girls an’ de white folks. (He sits there gloomily silent for awhile, then looks behind him and picks up his guitar and begins to pick a tune. The music is very sad, but he trails off into, “YOU MAY LEAVE AN’ GO TO HALIMUHFACKS, BUT MY SLOW DRAG WILL BRING YOU BACK.” When he finishes he looks at the sun and picks up his coat.)</p>
				<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">JIM</td>
				Reckon I better git on down de road and git some where. Lawd knows where. (Stops suddenly in his tracks and turns back toward the village. Takes a step or two.) All dat mess and stink for nothin’. Dave know good an’ well I didn’t meant to hurt him much. (He takes off his cap and scratches his head thoroughly. Then turns again and starts on down the road left. Enter DAISY, left, walking fast and panting, her head down. They meet.)</p>

				Not by they selves though ... wid de help of dat box, Jim. When you gits having fits on dat box, boy, my foots has hysterics. Daisy, you marry Jim cause I don’t want to come between y’all. He’s my buddy.</p>
				<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">JIM</td>
				Come to think of it, Dave, she was yourn first. You take and handle dat spade for her.</p>
				<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">DAVE</td>
				You heard her say it is all I can do to lift up dese feets and put ’em down. Where I’m going to git any time to wrassle wid any hoes and shovels? You kin git round better’n me. You done won Daisy ... I give in. I ain’t going to bite no fren’ of mine in de back.</p>
				<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">DAISY</td>
				Both of you niggers can git yo’ hat an’ yo’ heads and git on down de road. Neither one of y’all don’t have to have me. I got a good job and plenty men beggin for yo’ chance.</p>
				<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">JIM</td>
				Dat’s right, Daisy, you go git you one them mens whut don’t mind smelling mules ... and beating de white folks to de barn every morning. I don’t wanta be bothered wid nothin’ but dis box.</p>
				<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">DAVE</td>
				And I can’t strain wid nothin’ but my feets.</p>
				<tr><td/><td><i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">DAISY walks slowly away in the direction from which she came. Both watch her a little wistfully for a minute. The sun is setting.</i></td></tr>
				<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">DAVE</td>
				Guess I better be gittin’ on back ... it’s most dark. Where you goin’ Jim?</p>
				<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">JIM</td>
				I don’t know, Dave. Down de road, I reckon.</p>
				<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">DAVE</td>
				Whyncher come on back to town. ’Tain’t no use you proguein’ up and down de railroad track when you got a home.</p>
				<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">JIM</td>
				They done lawed me way from it for hittin’ you wid dat bone.</p>
				<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">DAVE</td>
				Dat ain’t nothin’. It was my head you hit. An’ if I don’t keer whut dem old ugly-rump niggers got to do wid it?</p>
				<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">JIM</td>
				They might not let me come in town.</p>
				<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">DAVE</td>
				(Seizing JIM’s arm and facing him back toward the town) They better! Look here, Jim, if they try to keep you out dat town we’ll go out to dat swamp and git us a mule bone a piece and come into town and boil dat stew down to a low gravy.</p>
				<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">JIM</td>
				You mean dat, Dave? (DAVE nods his head eagerly) Us wasn’t mad wid one ’nother nohow. (Beligerently) Come on, less go back to town. Dem mallet-heads better leave me be, too. (Picks up a heavy stick) I wish Lum would come tellin’ me ’bout de law when I got all dis law in my hands. And de rest o’ dem gator-faced jigs, if they ain’t got a whole sto’ o’ mule bones and a good determination, they better not bring no mess up. Come on, boy.</p>
				<p class="drama">(THEY start back together toward town, JIM picking a dance tune on his guitar, and DAVE cutting steps on the ties beside him, singing, prancing and happily, they exit, right, as</p>
