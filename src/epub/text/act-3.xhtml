			<p>SETTING: <i>A high stretch of railroad track thru a luxurious Florida forest. It is near sundown.</i></p>
			<p>ACTION: <i>When the curtain rises there is no one on the stage, but there is a tremendous noise and hubbub off-stage right. There are yells of derision and shouts of anger. Part of the mob is trying to keep JIM in town, and part is driving him off. After a full minute of this, JIM enters with his guitar hanging around his neck and his coat over his shoulder. The sun is dropping low and red thru the forest. He is looking back angrily and shouting at the mob. A missile is thrown after him. JIM drops his coat and guitar and grabs up a piece of brick, and makes threatening gestures of throwing it.</i></p>
			<div class="chapter">

Now just let some of you old half-pint Baptists let yo’ wooden God and Cornstalk Jesus fool you into hittin’ me. (Threatens to throw again. There are some frightened screams and the mob is heard running back.) I’m glad I’m out o’ yo’ ole town anyhow. I ain’t never comin’ back no mo’, neither. You ole ugly-rump niggers done ruint de town anyhow.</td></tr>
				<tr><td/><td><i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">There is complete silence off stage.

(He sits there gloomily silent for awhile, then looks behind him and picks up his guitar and begins to pick a tune. The music is very sad, but he trails off into, “YOU MAY LEAVE AN’ GO TO HALIMUHFACKS, BUT MY SLOW DRAG WILL BRING YOU BACK.” When he finishes he looks at the sun and picks up his coat.)</td></tr>

Then turns again and starts on down the road left. Enter DAISY, left, walking fast and panting, her head down. They meet.)</td></tr>
